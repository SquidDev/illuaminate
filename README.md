# ðŸ’¡ Illuaminate
Source code analysis for Lua

Illuaminate is a series of tools for working with Lua source code, providing
ways of making your codebase clearer and easier to understand. It's currently
rather bare bones, and still at a POC stage, but hopefully will expand and
become more useful as it continues to develop.

## Features
 - Many basic static analysis features (dead code detection, unused variables,
   etc...) as well as several formatting linters (whitespace, redundant
   parenthesis, etc...).
 - Automatic code fixer for many of the detected problems.
 - Documentation generation, using LDoc syntax.

## Building

**Note:** use the [upx][] executable packer in order to make the compiled
files a reasonable size (it reduces them by 4x). It should be included in most
package managers.

### Using Opam
 - Install [opam][] and set up an OCaml >=4.08.1 switch (e.g. `opam switch create
   4.11.1`).
 - Install all other dependencies: `opam install --deps-only --with-test .`
 - Build using Dune: `dune build @install @runtest`
 - You may either install illuaminate into opam using `dune install`, or use the
   files in the `_build/install/default/bin` directory.

### Using Esy
 - Install [esy][]
 - Run `esy` in the repository's root.
 - Illuaminate can now be run using `esy x illuaminate`

## Usage
 - Either build Illuaminate as above, or download a pre-built version:
   ```
   > wget https://squiddev.cc/illuaminate/bin/latest/illuaminate-linux-x86_64 # A x86-64 Linux static binary
   > wget https://squiddev.cc/illuaminate/bin/latest/illuaminate-windows-x86_64.exe # A x86-64 Windows binary
   ```

   You may need to `chmod +x` the downloaded file to make it executable.

 - Run `illuaminate lint` to lint the current directory, or `illuaminate lint
   my/sub/directory` to lint a specific file or folder. You should receive a report of
   all problems detected.

 - Use `illuaminate fix` (or `illuaminate fix my/sub/directory`) to attempt to
   fix any detected problems. This command modifies the file in place, so it's a
   good idea to check your files into version control before fixing, and make
   sure you're happy with the changes made.

 - You can get more fine-grained control over illuaminate using its
   configuration files. `illuamiante init-config illuaminate.sexp` will generate
   a template config file which can be adjusted to suit your needs.
